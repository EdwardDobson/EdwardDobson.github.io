<descriptionTitle>Floor</descriptionTitle>
  <descriptionInfo>To increase the variety of the dungeon I have developed a few different types of rooms.
        <br> I do this by taking a point in the dungeon and then picking which room type to use.</br></descriptionInfo>
  
  <descriptionTitle>Walls</descriptionTitle>
  <descriptionInfo>My first approach was to place tiles around the floor edges.
        <br>This caused some position issues with path end/start points.</br>
      <br>The new approach I took was to create another tile map and place the wall tiles in all of the empty tiles within the floor map.</br>
      This had three main benefits the first was the build time was decreased and it allowed me to implement a dig mechanic.
    <br>Finally this also fixed the path issues I was having.</br></descriptionInfo>

  <descriptionTitle>Paths</descriptionTitle>
  <descriptionInfo>To form a path I take two build points and then place tiles in the direction needed.</descriptionInfo>

  <descriptionTitle>Custom Block Variations</descriptionTitle>
  <descriptionInfo>What this project allowed me to do is implement custom blocks/tiles. 
    <br>These allow tiles to have attributes that can modify players stats such as speed and health, while still being a tile.</br></descriptionInfo>
