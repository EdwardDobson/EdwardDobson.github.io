  <descriptionInfo> When I first got the build for the game was horrible, hitting 80-100% usage on both my GTX 1070 and i7 9700k. 
    <br>With the games art style being simple and low poly I knew something was wrong.</br>
	<br>When trying to find out the cause of this issue I noticed that the batch call amount was hitting 20-30k.</br>
  <br>To reduce this I implemented Occlusion Culling which helped reduce the amount of batches massively.</br>
    <br>However they were still hovering around 2-5k in places, 
    this was due to the previous artist having several materials on one object rather than creating UV maps for them.</br>
    <br>To reduce the material amount I imported the models back into Blender removed unnecessary polygons and creating UV maps.</br>
      <br>This allowed me to static batch common objects, reducing the total.</br>
