<h1>Edward Dobson</h1>
<h2>Games Programmer</h2>

<img src = "Assets/ProfilePicture.jpg" alt="Me" style="width:150px;height:150px;margin:0px 0px 15px 15px;">
<introduction> I'm Edward. I have just finished studying a Masters degree at Teesside University in Computer Games Programming with a first. </introduction>
<introduction> I have been playing video games for most of my life ever since I first played the original Rayman on the PlayStation 1 nearly 14 yrs ago. 
  Over the years I have grown to love multiple game genres including strategy, first person shooters and Role Playing Games.  </introduction>
<introduction> When playing I like to think about how I would approach a certain mechanic and then sometimes try to recreate these mechanics in my own projects. I also like experimenting with smaller game engines such as Godot and using development tools that arenâ€™t required for my role.  </introduction>
